# Contributing

## Workflow

* Fork the project
* Make your bug fix or feature addition
* Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally
* Send a pull request

## Attention

Please make sure that you have set up your user name and email address for use with Git. 
Strings such as silly nick name <root@localhost> look really stupid in the commit history of a project.

Pull requests must be based on the current stable branch (master).
